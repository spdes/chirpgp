# Analyse bat calls

The scripts `./Eptesicus_nolssonii_analysis.py` and `myotis_myotis_analysis.py` analyse the social calls of two European
bats (i.e., Eptesicus nilssonii and Myotis myotis, respectively).

To run these scripts, you need to download the data from http://www.batcalls.com/. These sound recordings are

- http://www.batcalls.com/europe/playback/Eptesicus_nilssonii_1_o.wav
- http://www.batcalls.com/europe/playback/Myotis_myotis_2_o.wav

Download these two files then put them in this folder.
